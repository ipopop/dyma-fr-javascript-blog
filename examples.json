From there, the history of U.S. history tends to be shaped into four stages, which are shaped by the big ideas that shaped historical thinking at the time.\n\nThe founding generation of professional historians is generally remembered as being not much different in attitude from the amateur or 'gentlemen' historians that preceded them. But they did spend a significant amount of their time gathering and analyzing documents about political and military leaders and activities, and writing about them in exacting (many would say excruciating) detail.\"\n\nðŸ¤© ðŸ¤ª ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ¤ª ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ¥³",
